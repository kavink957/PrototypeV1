        <h1>Myopia</h1>
            <p>Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which near objects appear clear, 
                but objects farther away look blurry. <br/> It occurs when the shape of the eye —
                    or the shape of certain parts of the eye — 
                    causes light rays to bend (refract) inaccurately.
                In India, the prevalence in the population-based studies varied between 3.6% and 36.5%, 
                whereas the school-based, and the hospital-based studies had a prevalence rate of 7.5% to 8.6%, 
                and 9%, respectively.

            <ul>
                <li>Blurring of vision for distance</li>
                <li>Headache</li>

        <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>If you have myopia, more than likely, at least one or both of your biological parents do, too. 
                Eye experts are still unsure of the exact cause of myopia, 
                but believe it to be a mix of hereditary and environmental factors. <br/>
                It is possible that you can inherit the ability to be myopic. If your lifestyle produces just the right conditions, you will develop it.
                For example, if you use your eyes for a lot of close-up work, like reading or working on a computer, you may develop myopia. <br/>
                Myopia usually appears in childhood. Typically, the condition can worsen in early
                childhood but tends to level off by the end of teen years.
